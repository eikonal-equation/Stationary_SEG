*
* Description: The StationaryObstacle class. Depends on the CObstacle class.
* Currently only supports grid aligned rectangles. It is only responsible for
% figuring out whether any given point in the domain is contained in the
* obstacle. The idea is to have children shape classes, each having a isIn(x,y)
* which returns true if (x,y) is in the obstacle so that more general shapes of
* obstacles are acceptable.
