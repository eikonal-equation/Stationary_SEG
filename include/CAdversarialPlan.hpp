*
* Description: Computes the Nash equilibrium of a surveillance-evasion game.
* First the probability distribution is computed using a projected subgradient
* descent method, where the subgradient is the vector of partial costs
* (integrated observability from each position) at the source and the value of
* the function is the scalarized cost (expected integrated observability) at the
* source. Then the optimal probability distribution is perturbed to obtain a set
* of different paths which form a Nash equilibrium.
* It uses the class CFixedLambdaPlanner.
