* Author: Marc Aur√®le Gilles (based on Zachary Clawson's implementation of
* VanillaFMM)
*
* Description: This is a multiobjective Fast Marching Method class. It works on
* a 2D regular grid and a 5 point stencil. It assumes that the spacing in both
* the x and y direction is the same but the number of grid points can differ.
* The target set must be a single point. It solves the multiobjective problem
* by scalarization, which involves solving linear PDEs associated with the
* solution of the Eikonal. The solution to the Eikonal is stored in the fPrimary
*  variable, and the solution of the associated linear PDEs is stored in the
* fSecondary variable.
* The FMM implementation uses the boost::heap class, and CGridContext class.
