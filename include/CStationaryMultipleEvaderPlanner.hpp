*
* Description: This is an implementation of the CFixedLambdaPlanner class for
* stationary problems with multiple evader sharing the same source and speed
* functions, or simply a single evader. Its role is to build CGridContext,
* CStationaryTerrain, CStationaryObserver, CFMM and CGradientDescentTracer
* objects. It uses all of these classes to compute the pair of probability
* distribution and set of path which form a Nash Equilibrium.

     * The CAdversarialPlan Constructor.
     * This is the main CStationaryMultipleEvaderPlanner object constructor.
     * @param aObsLocations a Nx2 std::vector of std::vector containing the locations of the observer, where N is the number of observer locations. For example, initialize to vector<REAL_T> aObsLocations = { { 0.1, 0.5}, {0.4, 0.6}} for two observers at locations (0.1,0.4) and (0.4,0.6).
     * @param aSource a std::vector of std::vector of size Ex2 where E is the number of evaders, containing the (x,y) coordinates of the source of each evader
     * @param aTarget a length 2 std::vector containing the location of the target. All evaders share the same target.
     * @param aEvadersWeight a length E std::vector containing the weight of each evader.
     * @param aTerrain a CStationaryTerrain object specifying the obstacles. A std::vector of std::vector of coordinates, defining rectangular obstacles can be passed too, see the CTerrain object constructor.
     * @param aVis function pointer REAL_T(REAL_T,REAL_T,REAL_T,REAL_T) to a observability function which defines the observability of the domain from a fixed an observer position. takes 4 REAL_T inputs: 2 coordinates of the observer and 2 coordinate of the location that is observed. The function outputs a single REAL_T: the observability. Defaults to inverse squared distance: vis = 1/(| x - y|^2 + eps ). Note that all observers have the same observability function but parametrized by different locations.
     * @param aSpeed function pointer REAL_T(REAL_T,REAL_T) to a speed function which defines the speed of the evader at all points in the domain. takes 2 REAL_T inputs: 2 coordinates of the evader. The function outputs a single REAL_T: the speed at that location. Defaults to constant aSpeed = 1.
     * @param aN integer defining the number of grid points in each ShortDirection.  Defaults to 501 (observed to be sufficient to resolve line of sight).
     * @param aPartialCostGrids boolean flag which determines whether the secondary linear equations "v_i" are computed and used to compute the subgradients.
     * @param aMinPhys real number, the lower bound defining the square domain [aMinPhys,aMaxPhys]x[aMinPhys, aMaxPhys]. Defaults to 0.
     * @param aMaxPhys real number, the upper bound defining the square domain [aMinPhys,aMaxPhys]x[aMinPhys, aMaxPhys].  Defaults to 1.
